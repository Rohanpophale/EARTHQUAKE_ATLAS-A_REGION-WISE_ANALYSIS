PROJECT TITLE:

EARTHQUAKE_ATLAS-A_REGION-WISE_ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION: 

Earthquakes can cause widespread destruction and pose a significant threat and they are unpredictable and occur without warning hence it is essential to establish a system that can assist to find out regions prone to earthquakes. Hence use historical data to identify the patterns and intensity of disasters occurred in a region in the past and clustering can be used to group regions together based on disasters they are prone to.

METHODOLOGY:

![EARTHQUAKE-ATLAS-METHODOLOGY](https://github.com/Rohanpophale/EARTHQUAKE_ATLAS-A_REGION-WISE_ANALYSIS/assets/97818946/87feef76-3f46-4dd4-87df-826dacf499d2)

This is a MACHINE LEARNING analysis based project in which various clustering algorithms are checked for the highest efficiency according to are datasets.
And efficiency is calculated by using SILHOUETTE SCORE in which we concluded that according to dataset used K-MEANS clustering algorithm gives the highest efficiency of 0.737 and the execution time of 1.99 seconds
