# EARTHQUAKE_ATLAS-A_REGION-WISE_ANALYSIS

PROJECT TITLE:
EARTHQUAKE_ATLAS-A_REGION-WISE_ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION: 
Earthquakes can cause widespread destruction and pose a significant threat hence it is essential to establish a system that can assist to find out regions prone to earthquakes.

This is a MACHINE LEARNING analysis based project in which various clustering algorithms are checked for the highest efficiency according to are datasets.
And efficiency is calculated by using SILHOUETTE SCORE in which we concluded that according to dataset used K-MEANS clustering algorithm gives the highest efficiency of 0.737 and the execution time of 1.99 seconds
