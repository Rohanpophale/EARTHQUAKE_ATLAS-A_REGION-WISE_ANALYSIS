# EARTHQUAKE_ATLAS-A_REGION-WISE_ANALYSIS

PROJECT TITLE: 

EARTHQUAKE_ATLAS-A_REGION-WISE_ANALYSIS.



INTRODUCTION: 

Earthquakes can cause widespread destruction and pose a significant threat and they are unpredictable and occur without warning hence it is essential to establish a system that can assist to find out regions prone to earthquakes. Hence use historical data to identify the patterns and intensity of disasters occurred in a region in the past and clustering can be used to group regions together based on disasters they are prone to.

Highlight the key finding: After evaluating the clustering algorithms, K-Means demonstrated the highest efficiency with a silhouette score of 0.737.
Include the execution time of K-Means (1.99 seconds), showcasing not just the effectiveness but also the computational efficiency of the algorithm.
